                            The primary concepts that change when working in an already established codebase are that the design pattern has already been chosen and every change that you make has ripple effects throughout the codebase, even if only affecting tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To get a better idea of what's going on in the codebase and how it's tied together, place a debug breakpoint at the entry point and run the program. Follow it through startup and begin to interact with it, following each method. <strong>This should be done every time you begin a new PR,</strong> though with a more relevant breakpoint. With specific PRs the breakpoint should be the uppermost relevant entry point. Starting too close to where you think the change goes does not help nearly so much - maybe your guess was wrong and the change should be made much earlier in the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tests are important. Almost every PR should include at least one test, even if only to prove that the bug that was the impetus of this PR is fixed and will not occur again in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, take some time to figure out the design pattern in use. Oftentimes teams have both a preferred style and pattern. Take some time to familiarize yourself with how your teammates code and, with a little dose of wisdom, follow suit.

                        <p>
                            DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. One of the primary goals to bear in mind as you code is to keep your code as legible as possible without sacrificing too much performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you find yourself doing the same IF statement in two or three places within a method or a class, and it doesn't change during computation, then maybe it's worth doing the calculation initially and saving it as a well-named boolean to call to instead of redoing the calculation multiple times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other general solution is to create a method that does what you need and call to the method, rather than placing the code directly inline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One example of this is when I once worked with both a single item as well as a collection of the same type. The solution was to create a method that did the item calculation, as well as a method that did nothing but iterate over the collection and call to that single method. Both methods had exactly the same name, but with different parameters and return types to account for the collection vs single item distinction.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            There are numerous design patterns that you'll encounter and no project is limited to just one, but the most important and basic one that I've discovered so far exists both on the back and front end. I knew it originally as "MVC", but it's much simpler than that: it's nothing more than a separation of concerns via adding a layer between an outside entity and your business logic which results in a 3-layer system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the backend business logic goes in the Orchestrator and you manage acquisition of data within the Client (or 'Repo'), while you take incoming requests and send the results to the frontend via a Controller. In essence, the Controller is the layer between the Orchestrator and your frontend, while your Client is the layer between your Orchestrator and your database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the frontend the data is acquired via an API call and translated into a Model. The model is then manipulated within the Controller and sent to the View. In this scenario the business logic is handled in the Controller while the View is the layer that exposes this to the customer, and the Model/API call is the acquisition of data. In each case there are three layers with business logic at the center and protected from the outside via a layer between.

                            Dependency Injection

                        <p>
                            The concept is that each class is backed by an interface and we call to the interface itself, while setting a default implementation within the project. It's a roundabout way to execute the code, but allows for a simple, seamless experience in handling dependencies when creating and instantiating any particular class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first step is to have a class, let's say <span class="code">Animal</span>. Any methods that you'll want to make available outside of Animal itself will then need to have their signatures included in an interface, <span class="code">IAnimal</span>. Then, within C# at least, you'll want to find the setup file, which is usually that projects Program.cs. The easiest way to do this is to do a ctrl+alt+f on "AddSingleton". Within that file you'll then want to add a line similar to:  <span class="code">services.AddSingleton&lt;IAnimal, Animal&gt;();</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Assuming all is correct, then in any class that you wish to refer to the Animal class you'll want to include a field (<span class="code">private readonly IAnimal Animal;</span>), add <span class="code">IAnimal animal</span> to your class constructor, and in the body of the constructor line them up with <span class="code">Animal = animal;</span>. As a result, throughout this class you may now refer to the Animal class via Animal.METHOD. <a class="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection">More details about Dependency Injection here</a>.

                        <p>
                            Feature flags allow for you to build into your code a boolean validation using the FeatureManager. This is used in order to enable or disable a block of code, often surrounding the release of a new or time sensitive feature. I've used feature flags in the past when releasing a new non-critical feature into production testing, as well as when a feature is completed and ready to go, but cannot be released until after a specific date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The feature flag must first be defined within the ARM or Bicep template of the build pipeline, or manually within Azure. Once it's there then you may use <span class="code">IFeatureManager</span> such as <span class="code">if (await _featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(MyFlagName)){do stuff}</span>. It is recommended that you create a class explicitly to hold the names of each of your Feature Flags and any time that you refer to them you do so with the <span class=""code>NameOf:</span> convention. ...not quite sure why...

                            I'm not very familiar with Generics yet, but they're the <span class="code">List&lt;T&gt;</span> that you've seen in many tutorials. They seem to be utilized when you have the same series of actions inside a method that you want to execute for multiple object types. For instance, if you have multiple animals and simply want to get the average age of all pets. Ideally there would be a common interface that you could use as T, but if there is not a generic would work as well.

                        <h2>
                            Controllers
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In C# a controller should always inherit from <span class="code">ControllerBase</span>. Along with this, the class should be decorated as an ApiController and have a route declared. The route will assume itself to be your "baseUrl/classRoute". All methods within the controller are your individual endpoints. Each end-point must have its own route decoration. The url of the route endpoint is then added to the above making the end url "baseUrl/classRoute/methodRoute".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each controller in C# should return an IActionResult (or more likely, <span class="code">Task&lt;IActionResult&gt;</span>). This allows us to utilize the <span class="code">BadRequest(errorMessage)</span> and <span class="code">Ok(results)</span> responses which automatically sends a 400 or 200 to the front end. While it allows us to modify exactly what codes and messages we send to the front end, it also requires us to do so - for instance, a 500 will never be sent via BadRequest or Ok.
                        </p>
                        <figure>

                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            In the above example the route is <span class="code">/zip?00000</span>. The <span class="code">string zip</span> method parameter is automatically pulled out of the http request. Placing the call to your service (in this case, GetByZip) into a Try/Catch allows us to catch anything that is thrown by the back end. We can then evaluate that exception's details (statusCode, message, etc) and determine precisely how to handle it and exactly what to send to the front end - in this case it's a basic 'BadRequest' (i.e. 400) that passes along the message created elsewhere. If it's successful, however, it returns an "Ok", which equates to a 200, along with whatever object we put in the parenthesis... which must fulfill the contract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The downside of this approach is that it's not necessarily clear exactly what the shape of the return object is. It is not declared within the method signature, nor is it clear in the return line. As a result, I prefer to clearly type all C# (avoid the use of VAR). Another way to overcome this is by adding XML Summary and Example comments.
